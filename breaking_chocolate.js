// Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.

// For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size 2 x 1 you can split it to single squares in just one break, but for size 3 x 1 you must do two breaks.

// If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always be a non-negative integer.

// taking in 2 integers, may see invalid input - return 0
// returning one number, representing the number of times the chocolate must be broken. Print to the console?
// 4, 2 => IIII
// 10, 4 => 
// Need to check if simple math is possible
